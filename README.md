This is my book search web application. It contains all my favourite books that I've read so far. To navigate easily through this application you need to click in the menu on "Guide" section. All technologies that I used while building this application are listed here: 
      <b>- Java 8, Java EE, Servlets(backend)</b><br>
      <b>- HTML, CSS (frontend)</b><br/><br>
      <b>- Apache Tomcat(server)</b><br>
