# BookApp
This is my book search web application. It contains all my favourite books that I've read so far. To navigate easily through this application you need to click in the menu on "Guide" section. All technologies that I used while building this application are listed here: <br>
      <b>- Java 8, Java EE, Servlets(backend)</b><br>
      <b>- HTML, CSS (frontend)</b><br/><br>
      <b>- Apache Tomcat(server)</b><br>
      <b>- Docker/Mysql(database)</b>
      
## How To Deploy Docker
All you need to do is to go to "Docker for BookApp" folder with cd commend and deploy docker contener with docker compose commend:
      ```      
        docker-commpose up
      ```
After that all what is needed is to use adminer to load sql code from "Docker for BookApp" folder. Credentials to log into adminer are here:<br>
 #### User: root<br>
 #### Password: 123<br>
 #### Database name: books<br>
 #### Server name: books<br>
